# Rainfall-Prediction-end-to-end-ML-project
The main motive of the project is to predict the amount of rainfall in Vidarbha region or state well in advance. We predict average rainfall using past data.

# CONCLUSION
XGBoost and Random Forest performed better compared to other models. However, if speed is an important thing to consider, we can stick with Random Forest instead of XGBoost.
